# Getting Started with Create React App

This is my first application using React. 
After a couple of lectures from the React course, I decided to build something from scratch in order to put my knowledge into practice.
One of the main ideas of this project is to get to know â€˜Class Componentsâ€™ because they are a part of React. 
I am aware that React provides Hooks and I am going to use them in my next project. 

## What is Task management ?

It is a simple application where you can add your daily tasks, and set your own time for how long you are going to do it.  ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜Š

## Status

Project is: _in progress_,

## The goal of this project is to practice:

- Project setup to understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript for React (Requirements)
- Nested JSX, the basic syntax of React.js
- React Component syntax ( first to get to know better a Class Component later a Function Component)
- Components interacting
- Handler Function in JSX
- React Props
- React State
- Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class
  ...
